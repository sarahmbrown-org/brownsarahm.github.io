Dr. Sarah Brown is a University of California, Berkeley Chancellorâ€™s Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences. Dr. Brown received her BS, MS, and PhD degrees in Electrical Engineering from Northeastern University. Dr Brown builds machine learning tools that bridge from data-agnostic methods to systems that fuel data driven discovery in historically qualitative domains. Her work approaches this from two fronts: building interfaces that enable my algorithms to leverage domain scientists' qualitative expertise and developing model-based machine learning solutions through close collaboration with domain scientists. Sarah has been an instructor with The Carpentries since November 2017 serves as a member of the Lesson Infrastructure Committee. Currently she serves as treasurer and previously as a workshop organizer for Women In Machine Learning, Inc. She has served as general co-chair of the Broadening Participation in Datamining Program, a founding member of the Black in AI organizing committee and in various leadership roles in the National Society of Black Engineers.
