I build machine learning tools that bridge from data-agnostic methods to systems that fuel data driven discovery in historically qualitative domains. I approach this from two fronts: building interfaces that enable domain scientists to communicate their qualitative expertise to algorithms and developing context-appropriate machine learning solutions through close collaboration with domain scientists.
