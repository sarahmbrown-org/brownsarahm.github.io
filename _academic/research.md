I am interested in applying machine learning methods in the context of scientific problems and the unique challenge that poses: how do we learn and assess performance when uncovering the 'ground truth' is the objective? I take an engineering approach, starting from the specific problems of interest in the data, then modeling them and selecting appropriate performance measures to understand the performance of the model in the context of the problem.

My technical background is at the intersection of signal processing and machine learning, and I currently collaborate with psychologists, analyzing data from psychological experiments.
