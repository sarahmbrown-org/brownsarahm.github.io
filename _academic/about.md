*Machine Learning Researcher  ~ UC Berkeley Chancellor's Postdoctoral Fellow ~ Proven STEM Diversity  Leader*

I completed a BS in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Biomedical Engineering in 2011 a MS in Electrical and Computer Engineering and a  PhD in Electrical Engineering in 2016.

I am a Chancellor's Postdoctoral Fellow in Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley.  My faculty mentor is Professor [**Mike Jordan**](#https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/)

Sarah Brown is a Chancellor’s Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.  Sarah’s research focuses on the design and analysis of machine learning methods for use in scientific research.  This includes development of machine learning models and algorithms that are reflective of scientific thinking about the data, analyzing their limits in context and developing context-appropriate performance measures.

Sarah Received her BS, MS and PhD from the the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Northeastern University.  Her graduate studies were supported by a Draper Laboratory Fellowship and a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship.  Her dissertation, Machine Learning Methods for Computational Psychology, develop application-tailored learning solutions and a better understanding of how to interpret machine learning results in the context of studying how the brain creates affective experiences and mental pathologies.

Outside of the lab, Sarah is a passionate advocate for underrepresented STEM engagement at all levels. Currently she serves as treasurer for Women In Machine Learning and previously as finance and sponsorship chair as a co-organizer for the WiML Workshop. She has also served in a variety of leadership positions in the National Society of Black Engineers at both the local and national levels including National Academic Excellence Chair.
