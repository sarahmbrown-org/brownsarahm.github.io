Previously, I completed a [Chancellor's Postdoctoral Fellow](https://diversity.berkeley.edu/programs-services/postdoctoral/about-cpfp) in Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley with faculty mentor Professor [Mike Jordan](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/). I completed a BS in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Biomedical Engineering in 2011 a MS in Electrical and Computer Engineering and a  PhD in Electrical Engineering in 2016 advised by [Jennifer Dy](http://www.ece.neu.edu/fac-ece/jdy/) both at Northeastern University.
